Data-Management-and-Processing
## BACKGROUND

Online supermarkets and mobile apps are the most preferred form of grocery shopping these days.
That being said, it is important for retailers to effectively increase sales by analyzing trends in
customer purchase histories, identifying relationships between two or more products to create
bundles of items that might sell together. This kind of data analysis helps retailers in efficiently
managing inventory, decide pricing on items, and create focused offers targeting specific customer
segments.

## Purpose

This project mainly focuses on implementing various methods to predict which products a user is
most likely to buy in the next transaction session based on purchase history. We seek to demystify
trends in consumer purchases through exploratory analysis. Further, we aim to generate bundles of
items which are bought frequently by users also known as frequent itemsets. Also, providing
recommendations on product and department level based on an existing order.
